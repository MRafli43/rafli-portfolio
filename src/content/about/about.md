Hi, I’m **Muhammad Rafli**, a **Junior Data Scientist** with a strong focus on **machine learning, data analytics, and applied data science**.

I enjoy working with real-world data problems — starting from raw, messy data to building analytical models that generate actionable insights. My experience includes developing **LSTM-based sentiment analysis models**, **RFM customer segmentation**, and **computer vision systems** for image classification using deep learning.

Throughout my projects and internships, I have worked with tools such as **Python, SQL, TensorFlow, scikit-learn**, and **data visualization libraries**, emphasizing model evaluation, interpretability, and practical deployment.

I am currently seeking opportunities where I can grow as a data scientist, contribute to data-driven decision making, and work on impactful problems at scale.
