## Overview
This project focuses on classifying sentiment from social media text into **positive, neutral, and negative** categories using deep learning. The main goal is to build a robust sentiment analysis model that can handle noisy and sequential text data.

---

## What I Built
- An **LSTM-based sentiment classification model** for multi-class sentiment prediction  
- Text preprocessing pipeline including cleaning, tokenization, and sequence padding  
- Model training and evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics  
- Analysis of model performance to ensure stability and generalization on real-world data

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – data preprocessing and experimentation  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – LSTM model development and training  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – text cleaning, tokenization, and sequencing
