## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** analysis. The goal is to identify meaningful customer groups that can support data-driven marketing and retention strategies.

## What I Built
- RFM feature engineering to quantify customer purchasing behavior  
- Customer segmentation using clustering techniques  
- Evaluation of cluster quality to ensure meaningful and well-separated segments  
- Interpretation of customer segments for actionable business insights
